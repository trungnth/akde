# AKDE: Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation

AKDE provides a fast, adaptive kernel density estimator based on the Gaussian Mixture Model for multidimensional data. The [original MATLAB implementation][matlab] by Zdravko Botev does not appear to reference the algorithm described in the [corresponding paper][paper]. This Python re-implementation includes automatic grid construction for arbitrary dimensions and provides a detailed explanation of the method.
